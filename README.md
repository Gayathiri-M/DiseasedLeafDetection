# DiseasedLeafDetection
MATLAB based group project &amp; I was the main developer of this project

This is a MATLAB based Image processing techniques application that We have done for our group project for the University. I was the main developer of this project.
This application will take an image of leaf as an input and will run some image processing techniques on the image. It will output the procesed images of each main image processings and Finally it will prompt whether it is diseased leaf or Healthy Leaf.
